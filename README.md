# School District Analysis
## Overview

This challenge is intended to provide analysis of the district and school-wide impact of nullifying student math and reading grades that may have been compromised. Upon successful practice and completion of the coding required to replace the disputed grades from Thomas High School, I would be able to provide further analysis.

In the meantime, I am hapopy to report that my laptop arrived and I am almost caught up on the material through through Module 4. I recognize that may not appear much, however I feel more confident that I can complete future assignments in time (and will return to this assignment to resubmit).
