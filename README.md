# School District Analysis
## Overview

This challenge is intended to provide analysis of the district and school-wide impact of the exclusion of data that may have been comprised. In this analysis, the data in question 
is reflects the 9th grade math and reading data from Thomas High School. 

By updating the data set to exclude the Thomas High School 9th grade class, I am providing comparative data that can be used to further understand the impact of those students on district performance. 

## Results
### Impact of the Analysis on District Metrics
- Total Students: The total number of student decreased to 38709.
- Per Student Budget: The cost per student increased as the omitted students meant that district funding that supported those students now reflects a cost that will be attributed to the 10-12 grade classes at Thomas. 
- Average Math Score: increased
- Average Reading Score: 	increased
- % Passing Math: increased
- % Passing Reading: increased	
- % Overall Passing: increased

## Summary
### Changes to District Analysis

By removing the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School, the following changes occurred in the district analysis:

1. Average Passing Math scores increased
 
2. Average Passing Reading percentage increased

3. Total Overall Passing scores increased for the district

4. Average costs per student also increased

Without those scores, the District will appear to be performing better.
